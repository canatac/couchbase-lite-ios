/** CBLSuboducument is a suboducment or a nested document with its own set of named properties. 
    In JSON terms it's a nested JSON Map object.
    Like CBLDocument, CBLSubdocument is mutable, so you can make changes in-place. 
    The difference is that a subdocument doesn't have its own ID. It's not a first-class entity 
    in the database, it's just a nested object within the document's JSON. It can't be saved 
    individually; changes are persisted when you save its document. */
